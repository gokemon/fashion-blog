# Lets give this a try #

I was given the text of the page, and a picture of what it should look like.
I had to make the html and then the css file to make this a "pixel-perfect" page.

So far I am doing fine with it.

Started working on this back in April 2016, and kind of got it mostly there, but it wasn't perfect. It was merely an exercise to build your front-end analytic skills. 
Now, June 2017, and I find myself digging through my old code, thinking I should clean this up and finish the project.
